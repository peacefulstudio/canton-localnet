# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0) and `NOTICE` files.
- Community files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug report, feature request, config), and
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Apache-2.0 badge, project stewardship paragraph, Contributing block,
  and License section in `README.md`.

### Changed

- Licensing established as Apache-2.0. Every new source file must carry
  the two-line SPDX header (`Copyright (c) YYYY Peaceful Studio OÜ` +
  `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`) regardless of language; for
  future .NET projects in this repo, the central `<Copyright>` tag in
  `Directory.Build.props` is retained alongside the per-file headers
  (it drives the assembly attribute).
- Hardened CI workflows (`automerge.yaml`, `claude.yaml`):
  SHA-pinned third-party action `dependabot/fetch-metadata`, added
  `set -euo pipefail` and fork-PR-token guards on write-API steps.
